/**
 * After a successful login/register, establish the user's E2E account_key:
 *
 *   - If the server returned existing `vault_salt` + `encrypted_account_key` we
 *     re-derive the vault_key from the password they just typed and unwrap the
 *     same account_key all other devices use.
 *
 *   - If both are absent we treat this as first-time E2E onboarding: generate a
 *     fresh account_key + salt, wrap it under the password, PUT it back to the
 *     server. Subsequent logins (this device or others) hit the first branch.
 *
 * The returned key is persisted to localStorage + Capacitor Preferences before
 * returning so the AccountKeyProvider can read it back on a future cold start
 * without needing the password again.
 *
 * Returns null if WebCrypto isn't usable (very old runtimes); caller should fall
 * back to legacy scheme=1 messages — nothing breaks, the server still handles
 * them.
 *
 * Throws if the password is wrong (existing vault that won't unwrap) or if the
 * server-side PUT fails on a fresh setup. Callers swallow + show a generic
 * error rather than blocking login on E2E setup.
